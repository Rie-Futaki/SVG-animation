# SVG-animation
A personal project creating a SVG animation using CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and Adobe Illustrator.

*** WIP:

Things I want to add:

HTML:
Responsive layout using HTML bootstrap
Some headings and descriptive text about the project

CSS/JavaScript:
Fix the animations:
- Sparkles move when scaling
- I want to make the animation play when the cursor is on the bunny (e.g., "Pet the bunny").
However, currently the "mouseleave" event toggles when the cursor "leaves" one part of the bunny and enters another part (e.g., moving the cursor from the head to the body). Is there a way to fix this?
